### 8 call site

- to decipher what `this` refers too, we must understand the call-site - where it was called
- look at the call stack (the stack of functions that have been called to get us to the current moment in execution)
- The call-site we care about is in the invocation before the currently executing function (i.e. *where* it was called)
