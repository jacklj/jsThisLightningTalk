### 16 new binding

- what does `new` do?
	1. a brand new object is created (aka, constructed) out of thin air
	2. the newly constructed object is [[Prototype]]-linked
	3. the newly constructed object is set as the this binding for that function call
	4. unless the function returns its own alternate object, the new-invoked function call will automatically return the newly constructed object.
